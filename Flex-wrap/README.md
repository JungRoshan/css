# CSS Flexbox Playground 

 explored the CSS Flexbox module to create responsive layouts and arrange elements efficiently.
 
## What I Practiced

- **Created a Flex Container:**  
  Used `display: flex;` on a parent `<div>` to enable Flexbox layout for its children.

- **Explored Flex Direction:**  
  Set `flex-direction: row;` to arrange items horizontally.  
  (Also experimented with `row-reverse` to see the effect.)

- **Aligned Items with Justify Content:**  
  Used `justify-content: flex-start;` to align items to the start of the main axis.

- **Enabled Wrapping:**  
  Applied `flex-wrap: wrap;` so items automatically move to the next line when space runs out.

- **Styled Flex Items:**  
  Each child `<div>` was given a unique background color (rainbow colors), fixed width and height, and centered text.

## HTML & CSS Highlights

- The HTML file includes a heading and a container `<div>` with seven child `<div>`s, each representing a color of the rainbow.
- The CSS file styles the container as a flex container with wrapping enabled and aligns the items in a row.
- Each child `<div>` has a fixed size, white text, and a distinct background color.

## Key Takeaways

- **Flexbox** makes it easy to create responsive and adaptive layouts.
- `flex-direction` controls the main axis (row or column) of flex items.
- `justify-content` aligns items along the main axis.
- `flex-wrap` allows items to move to a new line when needed.
- Flexbox is ideal for building modern, flexible UI components.
