# Responsive Pet Adoption

Built a pet adoption webpage focusing on responsive Flexbox layouts and mobile adaptation.

## What I Practiced

### Flexbox Implementation
- Created card components with consistent 400px width
- Used `display: flex` for the main container
- Applied `justify-content: space-evenly` for optimal spacing
- Let images maintain natural aspect ratio with `height: auto`

### Responsive Behavior
- Implemented mobile breakpoint at 375px
- Added `flex-wrap: wrap` for vertical stacking on small screens
- Maintained card styling across all viewports
- Preserved image proportions during resizing

## Key Observations

**Desktop View**:
- Cards display side-by-side with even spacing
- Images fill card width while keeping proportions
- Border radius creates modern card appearance

**Mobile View**:
- Cards stack vertically when space is limited
- Content remains readable without horizontal scrolling
- All styling properties adapt seamlessly
