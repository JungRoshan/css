# CSS-Height-Width-Borders
focused on mastering CSS properties related to element dimensions and borders, including height, width, border styles, and border-radius.


## ðŸ”§ What I Practiced

- Set fixed heights and widths on `<div>` and `<h1>` elements.
- Applied various border properties:
  - Border width, style, and color.
  - Individual border side customization (e.g., `border-left`).
  - Rounded corners using `border-radius` and specific corner radius.
- Used padding and margin to control spacing inside and outside elements.
- Styled buttons with borders, border-radius, padding, and background color.
- Created a traffic-light style vertical container with three circular colored divs using `border-radius: 50%`.

## ðŸ“„ HTML & CSS Highlights

### First HTML & CSS File:
- `<div>` elements with:
  - `height: 200px; width: 500px;`
  - Pink background and yellow solid border with a thicker red dashed left border.
  - Rounded corners with `border-radius: 50px`.
  - Padding and margin adjustments for content spacing.
- `<h1>` element styled as a circle with dashed or solid borders and rounded corners.
- Styled `<button>` with black border, rounded corners, padding, and yellow background.

### Second HTML & CSS File:
- A vertical container (`#rect`) with fixed height and width and black border.
- Three inner circular divs (`.inner`) with different background colors (red, yellow, green), simulating a traffic light.
- Each circle has a black border and margin spacing.

## ðŸ§  Key Takeaways

- The `height` and `width` properties control the size of elements but do not include padding or borders.
- Borders can be customized individually on each side and rounded using `border-radius`.
- Padding adds space inside the border, while margin adds space outside the element.
- Circular shapes are created by setting equal height and width and `border-radius: 50%`.
- Combining these properties allows for versatile and visually appealing layouts.
