# CSS Flexbox (align-items)

Today I explored the power of `align-items` in Flexbox layouts, focusing specifically on bottom-alignment behavior.

## Key Concepts

▸ **Cross-Axis Alignment**  
The `align-items` property controls vertical positioning in row-direction containers (or horizontal in column-direction).

▸ **Container-Level Control**  
Alignment rules are defined once on the parent container but apply to all direct children.

▸ **Visual Consistency**  
Creates orderly layouts even with items of varying heights/sizes.



### With `align-items: end`
- All items snap to the container's bottom edge
- Tallest item defines the row's baseline
- Creates a clean "floor" effect
- Particularly useful for footers and bottom-anchored UI
