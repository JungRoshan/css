# css-transform-property-exploration
focused on the CSS transform property ( rotation, scaling, translation, and skewing) for manipulating elements in 2D space to see how each transformation affects layout and appearance.

## ðŸ”§ What I Practiced

- Used `rotate()` to spin elements by a specific angle.
- Applied `scale()` to stretch and shrink elements along the X and Y axes.
- Used `translate()` to move elements horizontally and vertically.
- Experimented with `skew()` to slant elements.
- Combined multiple transforms for more complex effects.

## ðŸ“„ HTML & CSS Highlights

- Created a section with five numbered `<div>` elements, each with distinct background colors using `nth-of-type` selectors.
- Applied a different transform to each div:
  - The first div is rotated by 45 degrees.
  - The second div is scaled to half its width and double its height.
  - The third div is translated 100px right and 100px down.
  - The fourth div is skewed by 30 degrees.
  - The fifth div is both rotated by 30 degrees and translated 150px to the right.

## ðŸ§  Key Takeaways

- The `transform` property is a versatile tool for creating dynamic and visually engaging UI effects.
- Multiple transforms can be combined for more advanced animations and layouts.
- Transformations do not affect the document flow, so elements may overlap or move outside their original positions.
