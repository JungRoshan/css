# Flexbox `align-content` 

The `align-content` property in CSS controls how browsers distribute space between and around flex items along the cross-axis when there's extra space in multi-line flex containers.

## Core Functionality
- **Cross-Axis Management**: Operates perpendicular to your `flex-direction`
- **Multi-Line Requirement**: Only affects layouts with `flex-wrap: wrap` or `wrap-reverse`
- **Space Distribution**: Determines how remaining space is allocated between lines

## Value Reference Guide

### Basic Alignment
- `stretch` (default): Lines expand to fill available space
- `flex-start`: Groups lines at container's start
- `flex-end`: Packs lines at container's end
- `center`: Centers all lines together

### Space Distribution
- `space-between`:  
  First line at start, last at end, equal spacing between
- `space-around`:  
  Equal spacing around each line (half-space at edges)
- `space-evenly`:  
  Equal spacing around and between all lines
