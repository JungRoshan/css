# CSS Position Property & Simple Smiley Face â€“ Day 16

Focused on different CSS `position` values and created a simple smiley face using positioned elements.

## ðŸ”§ What I Practiced

- Explored CSS position values: `static`, `relative`, `absolute`, and `fixed`.  
- Observed how `top` and `left` properties affect elements differently based on their positioning.  
- Built a smiley face using divs with `position: absolute` for eyes and mouth inside a circular face.  
- Used `border-radius` to create circular shapes and styled elements with colors.

## ðŸ“„ HTML & CSS Highlights

- Positioning Demo:  
  - Four yellow boxes each demonstrating one position type (`static`, `relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`).  
  - Each box offset by `top: 100px; left: 100px` to show how positioning works.  
- Smiley Face:  
  - Orange circular face (`border-radius: 50%`).  
  - Two black circular eyes positioned absolutely.  
  - Brown mouth with rounded bottom corners positioned absolutely.

## ðŸ§  Key Takeaways

- `static` ignores `top` and `left` offsets and follows normal flow.  
- `relative` moves relative to its normal position.  
- `absolute` positions relative to the nearest positioned ancestor or viewport.  
- `fixed` stays fixed relative to the viewport regardless of scrolling.  
- Combining positioning with shape and color properties can create fun UI elements.
